- *.role :: produced by PALAVRAS 'por.pl --role' with dependencies,
   semantic prototypes and SRL.

- *.role.conllu :: converted from the *.role using cl-connlu code (see
                   palavras.lisp in the lib) preserving the PALAVRAS
                   schema. This is just a conversion of niceline to
                   CoNNL-U. This files listed in
                   niceline-to-conllu.log were not converted.

- *.conllu :: produced by PALAVRAS 'por.pl --udep' (note this is based
              on UD 1.4 not UD 2.0. Moreover, we lost the semantic
              prototype tags -- i.e. <hum> etc)
