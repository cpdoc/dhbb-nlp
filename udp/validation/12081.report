See https://universaldependencies.org/contributing_language_specific.html for further guidelines.
All features including universal must be specifically turned on for each language in which they are used.
See https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_feature.pl for details.
